# Compile and Run

I suppose you have already installed the mingw or the cmake, since this OpenGL project needed to be compiled by the `Makefile` I wrote.

You can use the following command to compile.

```bash
$ make 
```

You can use the following command to compile and run.

```bash
$ make run
```

You can use the following command to clean all compiled products.

```bash
$ make clean
```

By the way, I've already generated the executable file, you can directly run this `main.exe` file. But please make sure that `main.exe` and `glfw3.dll` is in the same directory. You can use the following command to directly run the executable file.

```bash
$ .\main.exe
```
